**prompt** to instruct an AI coding agent (or developer assistant) to build the **complete frontend** for your AI-powered, NFT-governed AMM MVP ‚Äî exactly as described above:

---

## üéØ **Zero-Shot Frontend Prompt**

> You are a full-stack React developer. Your task is to build the **complete frontend interface** for a production-ready decentralized application (dApp) that integrates:
> - AI-powered crypto trading using [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade),
> - NFT-based ownership, rewards, and governance using [NFT-Incentivized-Crypto-Crowdfunding](https://github.com/dvoronkov/NFT-Incentivized-Crypto-Crowdfunding),
> - Ethereum-compatible smart contracts (ERC-721 and profit distribution).
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not rewrite any backend logic. This frontend should only interface with existing backend APIs and Web3 smart contracts.**
